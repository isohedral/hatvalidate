### Manage cells in the [3.4.6.4] tiling using integer coordinates.
### First, we give integer coordinates to the hexagons in the regular
### [3^6] tiling, by giving coordinates relative to a basis with axes
### (1,0) and (1/2,sqrt(3)/2).  Then we superimpose a scaled-up kite
### tiling, so that every kite is uniquely associated with a hexagon
### (and a fraction of the hexagons don't have a corresponding kite).
### See the illustration in kitegrid.pdf.
